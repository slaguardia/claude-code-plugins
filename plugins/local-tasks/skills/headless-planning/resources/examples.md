## Example 4: Team Async Workflow

**Day 1 - Developer creates planning doc:**
```bash
/headless-planning "implement real-time notifications"
```

**Day 1 - PM reviews and answers questions in Linear/GitHub/etc:**
- Opens `planning-real-time-notifications.md`
- Fills in answers based on product requirements
- Commits changes

**Day 2 - Developer continues:**
```bash
/headless-planning planning-real-time-notifications.md
```

**Claude creates task files, developer starts implementation:**
```bash
/ralph FEAT-20240116_090000-n2k8
```

This workflow allows async collaboration without requiring real-time chat.
