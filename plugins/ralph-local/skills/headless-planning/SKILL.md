# Headless Iterative Planning (Local Tasks)

Asynchronous planning workflow that uses markdown files as the communication medium. Questions and answers happen directly in a planning document, not in chat.

**End goal:** Local JSON task files containing a feature definition and user stories with acceptance criteria.

## The Job

1. User provides a feature idea (or existing planning document to continue)
2. **If existing document provided:** Read it first, review what's already planned
3. Claude creates/updates a markdown planning document with embedded questions
4. User answers questions by editing the markdown file
5. User returns and asks Claude to continue (`/headless-planning planning-doc.md`)
6. Claude reads answers, asks follow-up questions OR creates task files
7. Repeat until planning is complete

**Key difference from interactive-planning:** All Q&A happens in a markdown document, not in chat.

## Workflow States

### State 1: Questions Pending

```markdown
# Feature Planning: [Feature Title]

## Summary
[Initial understanding of the feature]

---

## Planning Questions

### 1. What problem does this solve?
**Your answer:** [ANSWER HERE]

### 2. Who is the primary user?
**Your answer:** [ANSWER HERE]

### 3. What's the scope?
**Your answer:** [ANSWER HERE]

---

**Status:** Waiting for answers. Once complete, run: `/headless-planning planning-doc.md`
```

### State 2: Ready for Task Files

```markdown
# Feature Planning: [Feature Title]

## Summary
[Refined summary based on answers]

## Out of Scope

- [Item 2]

## Technical Considerations

---

**Status:** Planning complete. Task files created in .tasks/FEAT-xxx/
```

## Step 1: Initial Document Creation

When user provides a feature idea:

1. Create planning markdown document
2. Filename: `planning-[feature-slug].md`
3. Document contains:
   - Initial summary
   - 3-5 clarifying questions with answer placeholders
   - Instructions for user
   - Status indicator

### Question Format

```markdown
### 1. [Question]
**Your answer:** [ANSWER HERE]
```

## Step 2: Continue Planning

When user provides a planning document path:

1. Read the planning document
2. Parse answers from the document
3. Check if existing task files already exist
4. Create task files if ready, or ask follow-up questions

## Step 3: Create Task Files

When all questions are answered:

1. Update planning document with final feature design
2. Remove questions section
3. Create task files in `.tasks/` directory
