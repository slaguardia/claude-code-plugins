# Policy Cohesion Audit

Review all policy documents together for cohesiveness, tone consistency, and structural alignment.

## Documents to Review
1. Terms of Service
2. Privacy Policy
3. Safety Notice
4. Community Guidelines
5. Copyright / DMCA Policy

## Evaluation Criteria

### 1. Cohesion Across All Documents
- Do definitions match across documents?
- Does core terminology stay consistent? (e.g., "Events," "User Content," "Host")
- Do documents contradict each other or create conflicting obligations?
- Do they refer to the product in a unified way?

### 2. Tone & Writing Style
- Is the tone consistent across all documents?
- Are some documents overly formal while others are conversational?
- Identify places where tone should be harmonized.

### 3. Structural Alignment
- Do the documents follow a logically consistent structure?
- Are similar topics grouped similarly?
- Should any sections be moved to a different document?

### 4. Redundancy Detection

Identify overlapping content such as:
- Safety warnings repeated across multiple docs
- Disclaimers that belong in the ToS but appear elsewhere
- Rules that appear in both Guidelines and ToS
- Definitions repeated unnecessarily

For each redundancy:
- Recommend where content should primarily live
- Recommend what other documents should do instead (e.g., link back)

### 5. Gaps / Missing Links

Identify:
- Areas where cross-references should exist
- Missing disclaimers or clarifications
- Concepts referenced but not defined anywhere
- Missing references to other relevant documents

### 6. Document Role Alignment

Ensure each document stays in its lane:
- **Terms of Service** - binding legal agreement
- **Privacy Policy** - data handling rules
- **Safety Notice** - non-binding safety recommendations
- **Community Guidelines** - behavioral expectations, non-contractual

Flag content that has drifted into the wrong category.
