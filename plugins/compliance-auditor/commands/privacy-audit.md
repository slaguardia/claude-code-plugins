## Evaluation Criteria

### 1. Compliance With Major Privacy Laws

#### GDPR
- Lawful basis for processing
- Data subject rights

- Consent requirements
- Retention schedule
- Deletion rules

#### General Best Practices

### 2. Transparency & Language Quality

Evaluate:
- Clarity of writing (plain language vs legalese)
- Excessive vagueness or catch-all language
- Overbroad permissions without justification

### 3. User Rights & Controls

Identify:
- Which rights are included (access, deletion, correction, opt-out)

### 5. Recommendations

Provide actionable improvements:
- Add retention periods
- Specify lawful basis
- Add "Do Not Sell/Share" explanation if applicable
