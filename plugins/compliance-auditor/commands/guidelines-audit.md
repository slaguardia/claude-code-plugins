# Community Guidelines Audit

Audit community guidelines for clarity, completeness, and consistency.

**Note:** Do NOT treat guidelines as a legal contract. These are behavioral rules, not binding terms.

## Evaluation Criteria

### 1. Clarity & User Understanding
- Are the rules easy for normal users to understand?
- Are expectations stated plainly?
- Are examples helpful and consistent?
- Are any rules vague or too broad ("inappropriate content", "don't be harmful")?

### 2. Completeness of Behavioral Standards

Check whether guidelines clearly cover:
- Respectful behavior
- Safety and harm prevention
- Authenticity and anti-fraud expectations
- Content boundaries (no explicit content, no violence)
- Protection of minors
- Reporting mechanisms
- Enforcement actions explained at high level

### 3. Consistency With Other Policies

Identify mismatches or overlaps with:
- Terms of Service (contracts, enforcement, rules)
- Privacy Policy (data collection, user rights)
- Copyright/DMCA (IP rules)
- Safety Notice

Flag:
- Conflicts
- Redundant rules
- Areas where guidelines promise something the ToS does not

### 4. Tone & Accessibility

Assess whether:
- Tone is respectful, welcoming, and readable
- Guidelines feel fair and not overly punitive
- Policy avoids legal jargon
- Document is structured clearly

### 5. Risk Assessment

Provide ratings (Low/Medium/High):
- Clarity & Readability
- Completeness of Behavioral Standards
- Cross-Policy Consistency

### 6. Recommendations

Suggest improvements such as:
- Add examples for ambiguous rules
- Break long sections into smaller bullet points
- Align enforcement descriptions with ToS
- Add clarifications where users may misunderstand
- Ensure tone is friendly rather than legalistic
