# Terms of Service Audit

Audit terms of service for clarity, enforceability, and legal compliance.

## Evaluation Criteria

### 1. Clarity & Enforceability
- Are rights, obligations, and limitations stated clearly?
- Could any clause be interpreted multiple ways?
- Are undefined terms used?
- Are important concepts buried or hard to notice?

### 2. Fairness & Balance

Identify clauses that are overly broad, one-sided, or unreasonable:
- "We may terminate at any time for any reason"
- Unlimited or vague data or content rights
- Liability waivers that attempt to waive non-waivable rights

### 3. Legal Compliance

### 4. Consistency With Other Policies
